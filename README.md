==================

(SQL) queries on a catering database

This was a lab for a class I took in database management.

##The Catering Database
This relational database includes eight tables used in "Richard's Catering."  On pages 2-5 of CateringQuestions.pdf, you can see a rough schema describing the tables and how they are related by foreign keys.

The first page of CateringQuestions.pdf includes questions about these databases.  The tables and data are loaded on an Oracle server and begin with the prefix mr_.

##SQL file
The questions, scratch notes, comments, and query output are recorded as comments in the SQL file.
